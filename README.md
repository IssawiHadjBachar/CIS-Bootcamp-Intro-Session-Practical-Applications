### AI Journey with CIS ISIMG - Intro Session Practical Applications
This repository contains the practical applications for the introductory session of the "AI Journey with CIS ISIMG." Where, we explore data manipulation and preprocessing for machine learning using a Fortnite and bitcon dataset.

## Introduction
As part of the "AI Journey with CIS ISIMG," this practical session is aimed at introducing participants to fundamental concepts in data manipulation and preprocessing for machine learning. We will work with a Fortnite dataset, extracting useful insights and preparing the data for future model building.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
 - pandas
 - numpy

## Results
A cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for machine learning models. Insights into key features of the Fortnite and bitcoin dataset.

## Conclusion
This repository introduces participants to the essentials of data manipulation and preprocessing, providing a strong foundation for building machine learning models.
